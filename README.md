##
A simple web app with a button that toggles between 3 colors on each 
click. Additionally, if you don't click, it automatically changes the 
color every 10 seconds. The sole purpose of this app is for me to 
practice.

## Run the app

If you want to run this application, download all the files on your local 
machine in a single directory, then open the "index.html" file with your 
favorite web browser

## How to use it

The app is changing the colours at every ten secconds, on or every click 
you made on it.
